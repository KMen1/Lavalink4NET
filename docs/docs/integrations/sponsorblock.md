# SponsorBlock

SponsorBlock is an open-source crowdsourced browser extension and service that skips sponsor segments in YouTube videos. It is available as a browser extension for Firefox, Chrome, and Edge.

The SponsorBlock plugin for Lavalink allows you to skip sponsor segments in YouTube videos. The plugin will automatically detect sponsor segments and will skip them.

Lavalink4NET provides an integration for the SponsorBlock plugin with the [`Lavalink4NET.Integrations.SponsorBlock`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Lavalink4NET.Integrations.SponsorBlock) package.
