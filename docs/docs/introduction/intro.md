# Intro

Using Discord music bots is an awesome way to bring some musical vibes to your server. These bots are capable of playing tunes from various sources like YouTube, SoundCloud, and Spotify â€“ a musical medley at your fingertips!

Now, if you're thinking about crafting your very own music bot, be prepared to juggle a bunch of tasks: handling audio playback, managing the queue, executing searches, sorting out permissions, keeping an eye on rate limits, interacting with APIs, tackling authentication... and the list goes on. Yep, it's quite the endeavor!

And guess what? If you're leaning towards using C# or some other language of the .NET world for your bot, say hello to Lavalink4NET. This library is your golden ticket to easily hook up with Lavalink and seamlessly integrate it into your bot project.

Lavalink4NET will handle everything related to music, so you can focus on the fun stuff: building your bot's personality, adding new features, and making it stand out from the crowd.

At first, there are some things, we need to get done. The first step is to set up Lavalink4NET and Lavalink itself. After that, we will create a simple bot that can play music. Finally, we will add some more features to our bot.
