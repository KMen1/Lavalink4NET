# Intro

Playing music is some of the most common use cases for Discord bots. Lavalink4NET is a library that makes it easy to add music playback to your bot from various sources including YouTube, SoundCloud, and Spotify.

Now, if you're thinking about crafting your very own music bot doing it natively can be a hard task: handling audio playback, managing the queue, executing searches... and the list goes on.

If you're leaning towards using C# or some other language of the .NET world for your bot, Lavalink4NET will make integrating music really easy. This library can easily hook up with Lavalink and seamlessly integrate it into your bot project.

Lavalink4NET will handle everything related to music, so you can focus on the fun stuff: building your bot's personality, adding new features, and making it stand out from the crowd.

At first, there are some things, we need to get done. The first step is to set up Lavalink4NET and Lavalink itself. After that, we will create a simple bot that can play music. Finally, we will add some more features to our bot.
