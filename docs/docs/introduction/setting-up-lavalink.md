# Setting up Lavalink

If you are new to bot developing and/or Lavalink, you might be wondering what Lavalink is and why you need it. Lavalink is a standalone audio player that is used by many Discord music bots. It is written in Java and can be hosted on your own server or even computer. Lavalink4NET is a library that allows you to easily connect to Lavalink and use it in your bot.

Lavalink itself is a standalone executable which you can download. Please refer to the [official Lavalink documentation](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/Lavalink) for more information on how to set it up.

If you need any help with setting up lavalink, don't hesitate to ask in our discord server.
