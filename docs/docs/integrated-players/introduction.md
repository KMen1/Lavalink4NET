# Introduction

A lavalink player represents a voice/audio session with a Discord guild. It is used to play audio tracks in a voice channel.

:::info
Lavalink4NET lowest abstraction level is the `ILavalinkPlayer` interface. If you need fine grained control over the player, you can use this interface. It is recommended to use the default `LavalinkPlayer` class instead, in nearly all cases.
